## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- CSS FlexBox

### What I learned

- @import url(website given in the css guide file)
- background-image: url(..path..);
- background-repeat: repeat/no repeat;
- background-size: contain/stretch;
- tranform: translate(-50%, -50%);
- @media only screen and (...)
- we have to deal with latest and the nearest parent instead the furthest to position an element using flexbox layout
- height affect on the places and the positions of each element in a container
